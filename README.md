## Overview of the Project

This project aims to solve the problem of tracking the full supply chain from the production of coffee beans to the consumer hands.

Utilising a Streamlit front end this supply chain tracks the transactions and movement of coffee beans from:
* Harvestor
* Storage
* Roaster
* Retailer
* Consumer

Ultimately allowing the end user (consumer) to scan a QR code enabling them to access the full history of the supply chain of a specific bag of coffee.
